# LitteWord

This is the front end part for the LittleWord news app

I'm creating it again from scratch using functional component, hooks, Context, ...

Doesn't do much for now. You can just click on different navigation items in the menu and see the title change

## What's new
- Settings page. Settings get stored in local storage. Local storage updates the state on load

## Coming Soon

- See the news for the WORLD section
